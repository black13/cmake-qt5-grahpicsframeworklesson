/*! \mainpage Example Qt QGraphicsItem implemenation
 *
 * Example usage of a custom QGraphicsItem in a QGraphicsScene with examples of mouse hover events.
 *
 * My goal was to create a simpe box, in the shape of a UML State/Class box, with a title
 * area seprated from a main arear below by line.
 *
 * This sample class inherits from QGraphicsItem, and must reimplement boundingRect() and paint()
 * from the base class.
 *
 * To learn about handling mouse events in a QGraphicsScene, I wanted my box to turn red when the mouse moves inside, and black
 * when the mouse moves out.

/*!
 * \class MainWindow
 *
 *  I created the project with QtCreator. I started a new C++ UI project. But I did not use
 *  creator to add widgets to the main window, but rather created instances of the widgets myself.
 *  QtCreator started a mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp files (when it created the UI project) - from there I added my widgets.
